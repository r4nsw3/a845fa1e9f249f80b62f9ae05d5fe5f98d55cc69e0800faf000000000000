  |   Tucked away from the outside world by the impenetrable haze of the    |
  |   Misty Woods, the village of Adam has mostly lived in peace since      |
  |   the days of the Wraith War. The dark power that fueled that war has   |
  |   vanished, but darkness is descending once more and Adam's legendary   |
  |   hero, Orazio, is no more.                                             |

  |   leaving his son and adopted daughter to wrestle with the dark         |
  |   secret he left behind - a secret that must now be revealed if the     |
  |   children hope to save both Adam and their departed father, though     |
  |   its revelation could unhinge the world.                               |
